To create waves there is a certain format that the computers will read.
Currently, the code goes as follows.

B = Basic
s = Speeder
b = Blaster

First place the single letter code and then follow with the relative coordinates from 0 to 1 of where on the board it should be placed relative to the top left point and the board size
Example:

B 0.1 0.1
b 0.25 0.3
b 0.05 0.01
B 0.2 0.1

On a Board size of 1000x1000 it spawns a Basic at (100,100), a Blaster at (250,300), a Blaster at (50,10) and a Basic at (200,100).

On a different board size, it will spawn the enemies in the same relative position to that point.

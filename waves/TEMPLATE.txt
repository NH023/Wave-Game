To create waves there is a certain format that the computers will read.
Currently, the code goes as follows.

B = Basic
s = Speeder
b = Blaster

First place the single letter code and then follow with the coordinates for spawning.
Example:

B 100 100
b 250 75
b 50 60
B 200 100

This spawns a Basic at (100,100), a Blaster at (250,75), a Blaster at (50,60) and a Basic at (200,100).

These are absolute coordinates and this will stay in the first instance of waves.
Later on, the coordinates will be able to be relative to the screen size for different screen sizes and playing fields.
